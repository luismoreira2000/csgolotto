                <p>Welcome to our # service on drawing items from the game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive
                </p>
                <h4>How does the drawing items take place?</h4>
                <p>All participants bring items or skins from CS:GO to the service. When the necessary number of items are acquired or the time for the game has already passed, the system randomly selects a winner who takes all the items. The one who added the most expensive items often wins. 
                    <br>How does it work?<br></p>
                <h4>It's simple enough:</h4>
                <ol class="decimal-list">
                    <li>You insert your skins in deposit.</li>
                    <li>The system calculates your tickets. For example: If your item costs $1, you get 100 tickets. But if the skin costs $10, you get 1000 tickets. And so on.</li>
                    <li>When you get the limit of 70 items, we collect all issued points together and randomly select one winner. The chance to win has the player, the points of which are higher than that of others. The winner-take-all draw items, commission deducted.</li>
                </ol>
                <blockquote>
                    <div class="blockquote-title">THE PRINCIPLE IS SIMPLE</div>
                    <div class="blockquote-content">
                        <p>The larger and more expensive items you bet, the more chance you have to hit the jackpot! But even depositing minimal sum, you have the opportunity to get all the items!
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </blockquote>

                    <li>The time of adding your deposit into the game varies from 5 to 30 seconds. In the rare cases it may take more time, because of queue of the players or Steam system lags.
                    </li>
                    <li>The trades with the winning are transferred instantly in automatic mode.
